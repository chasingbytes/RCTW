Modelling &amp; Predictions for Rising Tide Car Wash
Rising Tide Car Wash is a business in which 80% of the staff is on the Autism Spectrum and being a for-profit business, one of the main goals is to teach the staff how to make appropriate labor and sales desicions. An example of this is our conversion rate of 10% for converting retail customers to members. But with workibg at a car wash outside, it makes it harder to plan these moves since the customer traffic is strongly correlated to weather. 

Telling the staff to convert 10% of customers to members is diffucult to know how many exaclty to aim for, so how can we solve this? With data science of course! 

With this model trained on 3 years of daily car wash data and corresponding weather forecasts, a prediction model can be made. From there Streamlit was used for the user interface.
